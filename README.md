# Medicare_Spending_Data_Project

This is a Data Science project relating to predicting Medicare Spending for hospitals across the United States. Here you will find:
1. A file called "Final Model" which is the most recent iteration of this project. This is the one you should look at first. 
2. A file called "Initial Model" which shows my first model. My first model was not very good but posted it here in case anyone is curious as to my initial steps towards this project. 
3. Some research I did about Hospital Value Based Purchasing 
4. A Data Dictionary from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
5. A Zip file containing all of my Data Sets
